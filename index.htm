        <div class='bcontent'><h2>What is that?</h2>Have you ever played EarthBound? It was one of the best RPG games of its time. You watch Game Grumps? Well, if you didn't, you probably wouldn't be here. So how about we take those two things and merge them together? And so begins <b>GrumpBound</b> - a Grump-themed RPG based off EarthBound, where the chosen four - Arin, Dan, Jon and Ross save the world from Giygas, the universal cosmic destroyer.</div>
