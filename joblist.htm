        <div class='bcontent'><h2>The joblist</h2>You want to join our team? First of all, thank you. You're awesome.<br><br>Below you will find the information about who we need, what needs to be done and how to join the team, so you can help us create the best Grump game around. Together we'll make this game tenouttaten.</div>

            <h2>Who we're looking for?</h2>
            <b>Essentially everyone. If you can help the project in any way, you are valuable for us.</b>
            <br>
            You don't even need to join the team at all - if you'd just sent us a few suggestions, even once, it would already be a great contribution to the project.<br>
            
            <h2>What needs to be done?</h2>
            Generally, if you want to collaborate on the project, your skills should fall into any of the following categories.<br><b>We need:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Artists</b>, obviously. You do not want to know what happens when you leave several programmers in a room without an artist.<br>Artists of any kind are welcome - whether you make sprites, concept art, map tilesets, whatever else - we need you.</li>
                <li><b>Composers</b> - we generally want to reuse original EarthBound music, but reusing all of it would be unoriginal.</li>
                <li><b>Writers</b> - we haven't yet finished the storyline for the game, nor any of the dialogue outside the preview video.</li>
                <li><b>Level designers</b> - EarthBound was a big game, with many different locations. GrumpBound should not disappoint in this matter too.</li>
                <li><b>"Referencers"</b> - A title we made by ourselves. Gameplay is important, but so is entertainment. A game about Game Grumps should be filled with Grump jokes and references. The job of a referencer is to watch through all the episodes of Game Grumps, searching for potential jokes, characters, enemies and stories to include within the game. If you were paid for this, this would be the best job ever.</li>
                <li><b>"Suggestionists"</b> - Another title we made by ourselves. Coming up with interesting items, abilities and locations is hard. Suggestionists are supposed to help us with this problem. Suggestionists make suggestions on what should actually be in the game.</li>
                <li><b>Testers</b> - before releasing to the public, the game will need to be tested. We need actual players to tell us about their experience with the game. We're looking for people who have never played EarthBound before, as well as people who have.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Even if your skills do not fall into any of those categories, you should still contact us.<br>
            I'm not an angry, scary manager in a black suit. We're all a community, we're all lovelies.

-->&shy;&#x73;&#105;f&#x69;&#101;s@&#x67;m&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6D;</a>. Your subject line should include the word 'GrumpBound'. Just write what you can do. You can include some of your work, but it's not necessary. If you're accepted, you will be given access to a special developer subreddit, where all team members will coordinate their work. Naturally, you will need to have a Reddit account for that. Even better, you should send me your Reddit account name in the email.<br><br>As a reward, all team members will be mentioned in the credits, and will get to play the game before everyone else.<br>Because the project is strongly based on the "from community, to community" concept, you can't really expect to gain any money off your work. Although this might change if the game ever becomes commercial.
